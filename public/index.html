    <h1>Blacksmithing!</h1>
      <img src= http://cdn.notonthehighstreet.com/fs/08/18/c7af-81b1-4c3f-826c-60244fe90813/original_date-night-at-a-blacksmithing-forge.jpg>
        <p>I want to learn to blacksmith and forge armor. I am a very hands on individual, but have struggled to find a hobbie that excites me. Some people like musical instuments and others like fishing (which I also enjoy!), but I wanted to find something I could do at home. A was first introduced into blacksmithing from the show forged in fire on the history channel.</p>
    <h2>Gaming</h2>
      <p>One hobby I do currently have is online and offline video gaming. Again this is a hobbie that i can enjoy from home during my downtime with relative ease. Due to having friends that i grew up with in california, this is a fun way to keep in contact and still e njoy things we did as young kids.</p>
    <h3>Fishing</h3>
      <p>The hobbie that I enjoy with my children would deffinently be fishing. I try and take my children shore fishing a few times a month. Even tho i do have girls, they truly enjoy it as well. The look on their faces when they catch a big fish is absolutely priceless!</p>
