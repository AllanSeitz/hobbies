    <p id="blacksmith">I want to learn to blacksmith and forge armor. I am a very hands on individual, but have struggled
      to find a hobbie that excites me. Some people like musical instuments and others like fishing (which I also enjoy!),
      but I wanted to find something I could do at home. A was first introduced into blacksmithing from the show forged in
      fire on the history channel.

    <h3>Gaming</h3>
    <p>One hobby I do currently have is online and offline video gaming. Again this is a hobbie that i can enjoy from home
      during my downtime with relative ease. Due to having friends that i grew up with in california, this is a fun way to
      keep in contact and still e njoy things we did as young kids.</p>
